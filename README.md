# archery

Summary:

This game is an attempt at making a first-person archery shooting game. The idea was to find all the targets on the map within a certain time limit. Hitting the target closer to the center would earn the player more points. If the player found all the targets on the map, they would move onto the next more difficult level. 

Completed:

- Imported all assets that I wanted for the game
- Created a simple startup menu with a play button
- Implemented camera movements
- Created a scene with a terrain and multiple assets
- Created a first-person camera view
- Created a joystick

Incompleted/Struggles:

- Function of bow and arrow is glitchy and not functioning correctly
- With the bow and arrow functionality not working, target collision and scores were also incompleted.
- No background music or game sounds
- Movement across the map was glitchy and therefore incompleted.
